    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and process an interior image to extract a depth map\n",
    "2. Enhance the depth map using both GAN and diffusion-based methods\n",
    "3. Visually compare the original, GAN-enhanced, and diffusion-enhanced depth maps\n",
    "4. Create detailed 3D point clouds from each depth map\n",
    "5. Generate a properly textured mesh from the point cloud\n",
    "6. Apply advanced lighting for photorealistic rendering\n",
    "7. Export the 3D models in standard formats for use in other software\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion-enhanced depth map generally provides the best results for 3D reconstruction due to its ability to preserve detail while reducing noise. For professional use cases, the exported models can be further refined in 3D modeling software like Blender or Maya."
